# Python Collections
# collections — Container datatypes.
# This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.
#
# namedtuple(): factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields.
# deque: list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end.
# ChainMap: dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings.
# Counter: dict subclass for counting hashable objects.
# OrderedDict: dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added.
# Defaultdict: dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values.
# UserDict: wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing.
# UserList: wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing.
# UserString: wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing.
#

#
# An ordered dictionary can be combined with the Counter class so that the counter remembers the order elements are first encountered:
# 

class OrderedCounter(Counter, OrderedDict):
    'Counter that remembers the order elements are first encountered'

    def __repr__(self):
        return '%s(%r)' % (self.__class__.__name__, OrderedDict(self))

    def __reduce__(self):
        return self.__class__, (OrderedDict(self),)
