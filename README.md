# Python_Container_Datatypes
A demonstration of the Python ‘collections’ module - a framework for implementing container datatypes.  This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python’s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.   namedtuple(): factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields.   deque: list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end.   ChainMap: dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings.   Counter: dict subclass for counting hashable objects.   OrderedDict: dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added.   Defaultdict: dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values.   UserDict: wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing.   UserList: wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing.   UserString: wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing.  Compiled and presented by Vakindu Philliam.
